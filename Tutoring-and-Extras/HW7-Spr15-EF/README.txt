NAME:  < insert name >


COLLABORATORS AND OTHER RESOURCES:

ESTIMATE OF # OF HOURS SPENT ON THIS ASSIGNMENT:  < insert # hours >



ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE OF YOUR ALGORITHM:
(order notation & concise paragraph, < 200 words)

n = total number of words in the sample text file
m = number of unique words in the file
w = width of the sequencing window
p = average number of words observed to follow a particular word

How much memory will the map data structure require, in terms of n, m,
w, and p (order notation for memory use)?



What is the order notation for performance (running time) of each of
the commands?



EXTRA CREDIT
Parsing & using punctuation data, implementation supports *any*
window size, new test cases (describe & summarize performance, but
don't include large datasets with submission).



MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
(optional, please be concise!)
